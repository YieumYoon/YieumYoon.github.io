# Study Progress - December 12, 2024

Today, I dedicated time to learning and practicing the following:

1. **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**
   - Reviewed common DOM methods like `querySelector`, `createElement`, and `appendChild`.
   - Built a small project to dynamically update the DOM based on user input.

2. **Debugging Astro Components**
   - Resolved an issue with the `Records.tsx` component related to prop handling.
   - Improved the layout of the `records` page for better responsiveness.

## Goals for Tomorrow
- Explore advanced JavaScript topics like asynchronous programming with Promises and `async/await`.
- Work on optimizing Astro's image handling for better performance.
